\title{perform cross validation on a fitted occupancy-detection model}
\arguments{
\item{object}{occupancy model fitted with \link[occupancy:occupancy]{occupancy::occupancy}.}

\item{n_cv}{number of cross validation folds. Defaults to 10.}
}
\value{
a \code{list} object with cross-validated estimates of McFadden's r2 and AUC.

\description{
validate is a function to cross validate fitted occupancy-detection
    models. This function will automatically prepare folds and run full cross validation.
    Note: cross validation requires fitting models repeatedly and can take some time.
}
\details{
Cross validation is a useful method to test model reliability on new data. Many
    estimates of model fit are susceptible to overfitting. Cross validation attempts
    to avoid this risk by repeatedly partitioning the data and generating predictions
    for parts of the data not used during model fitting. This is an approximation of
    true model predictive capacity and still entails some risk of overfitting because the
    data come from the same statistical population and are not fully independent from the
    data used to fit models.
