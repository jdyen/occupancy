### occupancy is an R package for fitting occupancy-detection models with JAGS.

occupancy lets you write your model with a standard R mixed-model formula, and provides several methods for summarising, visualising, validating, and predicting from fitted models.

You can install the current version of the package (0.0.1) from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jdyen/occupancy")
```
