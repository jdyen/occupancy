#' occupancy: simple occupancy-detection models in R
#' @name occupancy
#'
#' @description occupancy lets you fit occupancy-detection models in JAGS without
#'   having to prepare JAGS code. Models are specified with a formula interface
#'   and can incorporate random effects. Models are supported by several methods
#'   to summarise, visualise, validate, and predict from fitted models.
